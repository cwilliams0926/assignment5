WinForms assignment that uses basic databinding to edit a person database.

# How it's made
**Tech Used**: C# and WinForms

This application specifically uses the .NET Framework's databinding tools. The database was made within the project itself using the SQL server connections. All controls were given through WinForms. The main form has a DataGridView control to display the database. It is read-only and cannot be edited directly. There are textboxes for name and phone number to display the current person selected as well as give the ability to change their name or phone number. There is a save button to save those changes to the database. There is an add button that brings up a separate form with controls and buttons to add a new person to the database.

# Lessons learned
This application, while simple, gave me a nice introduction to databinding and a more database-first approach to coding that I've never done before.
